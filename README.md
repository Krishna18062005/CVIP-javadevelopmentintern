# CVIP Java Development Internship Projects

This repository showcases a collection of Java projects developed during the CodeClause Virtual Internship Program (CVIP). Each project demonstrates the application of Java programming concepts to solve real-world problems.

## Projects Overview

1. **ATM Interface (`Atm.java`)**:
   - Simulates an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) interface, allowing users to perform banking operations such as checking balance, withdrawing, and depositing funds.

2. **Fees Management System (`FeesManagementSystem.java`)**:
   - Manages student fee records, including fee submission, balance inquiries, and generating fee receipts.

3. **BMI Calculator (`bmicalci.java`)**:
   - Calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on user input of height and weight, providing health status feedback.

4. **Number Guessing Game (`numbergame.java`)**:
   - A simple game where the user attempts to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range, with feedback provided on each guess.

## Getting Started

To run any of these Java programs:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Krishna18062005/CVIP-javadevelopmentintern.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd CVIP-javadevelopmentintern
   ```

3. **Compile and Run the Desired Program**:
   - Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.
   - Compile the Java file:
     ```bash
     javac Atm.java
     ```
   - Run the compiled program:
     ```bash
     java Atm
     ```
   - *Replace `Atm` with the appropriate filename (without the `.java` extension) for other projects.*

## Prerequisites

- **Java**: Ensure that the Java Development Kit (JDK) is installed on your system. You can download it from the [official Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/).
